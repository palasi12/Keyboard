/**
 * The §14 copy rules — the canonical list, rendered by the Help page.
 *
 * This is the ONE file allowed to contain the banned phrases, because it is
 * the file that names them in order to forbid them. `npm run check:copy`
 * excludes this path and fails on a hit anywhere else in src/.
 *
 * These are legal constraints, not style preferences. Breaking one is a
 * defect: the first is a false product claim, the second a trademark, the
 * third an origin claim the supply chain does not support, and the last two
 * are commitments nobody has authority to make yet.
